### ðŸš€ Enhancements and New Features

- A new placeholder `{python}` is supported by container execution.
  It resolves to the Python interpreter executable running DataLad
  on container execution. This solves portability issues with the
  previous approach of hard-coding a command name on container
  configuration.
